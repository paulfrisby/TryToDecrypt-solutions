# TryToDecrypt solutions
This repository houses a collection of solutions to and tools for the decryption puzzles from www.trytodecrypt.com

## Format
Each cryptanalysis puzzle is within a given difficulty level (easy, middle, hard, & too much!). You are provided with a ciphertext and the ability to encrypt arbitrary strings using the same encryption method used to create the cyphertext. Once you believe you have a solution you can submiti it and check if it is correct. If logged in when submitting a correct solution you will be given a number of points corresponding to the difficulty level of that puzzle (ranging from 1 to 4 points).

A leaderboard for total points earned is kept at https://www.trytodecrypt.com/ranking.php

A statistics page which keeps track of number of test encryptions per puzzle and per day is kept at https://www.trytodecrypt.com/statistic.php
